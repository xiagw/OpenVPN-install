Before opening an issue, please make sure:

- You installed OpenVPN with the latest version of the script
- You read the FAQ
- Your issue is about the script, NOT OpenVPN itself
- âš  PLEASE Post your OpenVPN version and OS for both the server and the client if needed

FYI, you can excute the script with `bash -x openvpn-install.sh` to enable debug mode.
